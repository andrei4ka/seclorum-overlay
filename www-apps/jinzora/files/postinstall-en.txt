You'll be taken through the web based installer. The web based installer is
fully documented and should describe each option that you'll have along the
way.

Jinzora recommends the following settings for php (php.ini):
     max_execution_time = 1200
     memory_limit = 32M (or higher)
     post_max_size = 32M (or higher)
     file_uploads = 1 (on)
     upload_max_filesize = 32M (or higher)

Also note that you may need to edit ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/settings.php and change
some default paths (/usr/bin rather than /usr/local/bin).

sed -i "s|/usr/local/bin|/usr/bin|g" ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/settings.php
should do the trick.
